# SparseML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zewemli/SparseML.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/zewemli/SparseML.jl)

SparseML is a set of tools aimed at making high-performance ML algorithms 
available in Julia. Obviously, the target is for sparse data with no real
optimization planned for dense datasets, e.g. video. Also, real-valued
inputs are only partailly supported, try discritizing with our built in
discritizer.
