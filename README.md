# SparseML

SparseML is a set of tools aimed at making high-performance ML algorithms 
available in Julia. Obviously, the target is for sparse data with no real
optimization planned for dense datasets, e.g. video. Also, real-valued
inputs are only partially supported, try discretizing with our built-in
discretizer.

Currently, this is being tested using Julia v3.0
